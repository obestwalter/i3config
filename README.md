# My [i3 window manager](https://i3wm.org/) config

**Disclaimer I: I keep this public, because enough people have asked me over the years how I configured my system. It's not meant to be copied as-is. It works for me. Take what you like and leave the rest.**

**Disclaimer II: To make things more complicated, I also use a self baked python tool that adds dynamic behaviours and builds the i3 config from a set of partials with added functionality. See [i3configger](https://github.com/obestwalter/i3configger). But you simply still can look at the generated [config](config) as the end result.**
